# Comprehensive Analysis of Telco Customer Churn

## Key Findings

### Customer Profile Most Likely to Churn

- **Contract Type**: Month-to-month
- **Tenure**: Less than 12 months
- **Services**: Fiber optic internet without supplementary services
- **Payment Method**: Electronic check
- **Monthly Charges**: Higher charges (premium services but without loyalty benefits)

### Most Important Factors in Churn Prediction

1. **Tenure**: The longer a customer stays, the less likely they are to churn
2. **Contract Type**: Two-year contracts significantly reduce churn risk
3. **Internet Service**: Fiber optic service correlates with higher churn
4. **Additional Services**: Lack of security and support services increases churn risk
5. **Payment Method**: Electronic check users churn more frequently

### Business Impact Analysis

1. **Revenue at Risk**: Higher-value customers (with higher monthly charges) tend to churn more
2. **Customer Acquisition Cost**: New customers (low tenure) churn at higher rates, potentially before acquisition costs are recovered
3. **Service Quality Indicators**: Higher churn in fiber optic services may indicate quality or pricing issues
4. **Contract Strategy Impact**: Long-term contracts are highly effective at reducing churn

## Recommended Business Actions

1. **Target Retention Programs**: Focus on month-to-month customers in their first year
2. **Service Bundling Strategy**: Offer security and support services at discounted rates to fiber optic customers
3. **Contract Incentives**: Create stronger incentives for customers to choose longer-term contracts
4. **Early Intervention**: Implement a 6-month check-in program for new customers
5. **Payment Method Diversification**: Encourage direct debit or credit card payments with small incentives
